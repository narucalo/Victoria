# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Victoria Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for mobile devices. The navbar is designed to be user-friendly and functional across different screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Features

- **Responsive Navbar**: The navbar adjusts its layout based on the screen size, displaying links inline on larger screens and within a collapsible hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- **Hamburger Menu**: On mobile devices, the navbar collapses into a hamburger menu. When clicked, the menu expands to reveal navigation links.
